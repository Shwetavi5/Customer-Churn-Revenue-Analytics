## Business Questions & Objectives

This project analyzes customer churn and revenue patterns using Python and 
SQL.
The key business questions addressed are:

1. Which customers are most likely to churn?
2. How does contract type impact customer churn rates?
3. How does customer tenure influence churn probability?
4. Are higher-paying customers more likely to churn?
5. Which payment methods show the highest churn rates?
6. Which customer segments generate the highest revenue?

## Key Insights & Business Recommendation

### Key Insights
- Month-to-month customers have the highest churn rate (42.7%), 
significantly higher than one-year (11.3%) and two-year (2.8%) contract 
customers.
- Customers using Electronic Check show the highest churn rate (45.3%), 
while automatic payment methods have lower churn (Credit card automatic: 
15.2%, Bank transfer automatic: 16.7%).

### Business Recommendation
- Prioritize retention for month-to-month customers and electronic check 
users by promoting longer-term contracts and incentivizing automatic 
payments (e.g., discounts, loyalty credits, or bundled offers).
